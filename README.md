## Lazyload images with React using Intersection Observer API

Lazyloading is a technique that defers loading of non-critical resources at page load time. Instead, these non-critical resources are loaded at the moment of need. This can result in faster load times and an overall better user experience, especially on slower connections.

## Intersection Observer API

The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's viewport.

## Demo

The images are loaded only when they are visible in the viewport.
